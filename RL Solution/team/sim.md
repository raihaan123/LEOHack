## Running the simulator

As stated in the readme, run the simulator by using 
```pipenv run python ./software/simulator/sim_gui.py --challenge 1```

To change sim challenge level, change the number after the command.

Controls are fairly self explanatory 

- Start, starts the simulation
- Pause, pauses a running simulation
- Play, plays a paused simulation
- Reset, resets the simulation
- Reload Controller and Reset, reload the team control code and reset to beginning
